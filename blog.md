# React From Scratch.

the prime motivation for this project is for me to understand how react works under the hood.

### React Component Lifecycle

1. Mounting
2. Updating
3. Unmounting

## Mounting

in simplest words -> When a React component is being inserted into the DOM.

## Updating

When a React component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state.

## Unmounting

When a React component is being removed from the DOM.

### Objective:

for this practice project, I will create a simple To-Do App using React From Scratch (RFS) library that I will build from the ground up.
